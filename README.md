# Aqua_Predict
Developed a machine learning predictive model for water quality index.

Objective: Developed a machine learning predictive model for water quality index, which is an essential task for environmental monitoring and management.

Data Source: Utilized data from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) as the primary dataset for your analysis. Using real-world data is crucial for building accurate models.

Data Preprocessing: Successfully applied skills in data cleaning, which is essential for ensuring data quality and reliability. Clean data is the foundation of any successful machine learning project.

Data Analysis and Visualization: Conducted data analysis and visualization to gain insights into the dataset. Visualizations can help in understanding patterns and relationships in the data.

Initial Model: Implemented a Linear Regression model as an initial prediction approach. Linear Regression is a good starting point for many regression problems.

Regularization Techniques: Applied Ridge and Lasso regularization techniques to enhance the performance of the Linear Regression model. Regularization helps prevent overfitting and improves model generalization.

Cross-Validation: Utilized Elastic Net Cross-Validation for model optimization. Cross-validation is essential for assessing a model's performance and preventing overfitting.

Alternative Algorithm: Incorporated Support Vector Regressor (SVR) as an alternative algorithm. SVR is a powerful regression algorithm known for its ability to handle complex relationships in the data.

Model Accuracy: Achieved exceptional accuracy, with SVR surpassing other models at 97%. High accuracy is a significant achievement, indicating that your model is performing well on the task.

Evaluation Metrics: Employed various evaluation metrics, including R-Squared (R2), Adjusted R2, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Residual Standard Error (RSE). These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of your model's performance and can help in comparing different models.

Overall, your work demonstrates a comprehensive approach to developing a predictive model for water quality index, from data preprocessing to model selection and evaluation. The high accuracy achieved with SVR suggests that your model is likely to be valuable for predicting water quality.
